							<h3>Herald Square to the Rockaways</h3>
						</div>
						It is common knowledge that adding salt to a wound is a cruel practice when the salt is administered by some unsympathetic rival.
						<br>
						But it is also common knowledge that some wounds must be reopened so they can heal properly, and that salt water is a miracle cleanser.
						<br>
						The water on the Rockaways is not exactly heralded for its cleanliness, but when the wounds we're cleaning are emotional, Fort Tilden Park will do just fine.
						<br>
						That is why I take the afternoon Wednesday and high-tail it from my weekly talk therapy appointment (is this not New York?) straight to the water and the empty horizon.
						<br>
						I'm into the recent trend of mindfulness practice as the center of my psychological life, and one of cycling's many purposes for me is meditation, especially when it is on a protected path more or less free of pedestrians and cars.  Ocean Avenue through Brooklyn is clearly the place to bring my troubles once Joanne has dragged them to the surface like the coast guard to a corpse.
						<br>
						First stop is <span><a href="http://www.spumonigardens.com/">Spumoni Gardens</a></span>, a unique, New York exclusive, Sicilian-style pizza joint, where I eat my feelings.  Their dough, cheese and sauce, served square-shaped on a paper plate, also serves as a metaphor for my own experience of my past, present and future; I just can't seem to figure out where one ends and the next begins, and so I experience them all as a single, gut-wrenching, anxiety-inducing entity.  My perspective is like Ant Man: compact, high-density, seemingly tiny and distant, but packing a full-sized, close-up, in-your-face punch that I can't see coming but still knocks me on my ass. <i>But I digress.</i>
						<br>
						Now Joanne has had her way with me, and Spumoni's has blown my mind, and still there is an overwhelming sense of emptiness in my stomach and where the scab was ripped away that only the ocean can fill.
						<br>
						I skip Coney, since I don't feel like getting <span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/27/nyregion/the-hugs-are-free-but-are-not-without-a-cost.html">pelted with an egg cream</a></span> today, and head straight for the Rockaways, the shoreline of hipsterdom, where I can reasonably expect everyone to be civilized and much cooler than I.
						<br>
						I am not disappointed.  Naked as I please, I soak up the sun, almost convincingly belonging, and stare the waves in the face.  They invite me to pass through the pain I must experience to move forward and repel the infectious waste my past will continue to produce until I clean out the reserves of illness beneath the surface.  I oblige.
						<br>
						I swim out only just past the point where my feet can still feel the shore--way beyond my comfort zone.  I struggle with my skimpy bikini, even beneath the surface, not out of modesty, but out of shame.  I reach that point where the uncomfortable feelings are arising and decide it's time to stop. I carry the stuff I came here to leave behind back to my towel to dry off a bit before slumping over to <span><a href="http://www.rockawaybeachsurfclub.com/">Rockaway Beach Surf Club</a></span> for a seltzer ("I'm driving") and to use the bathroom.  No one really talks to me, and I am simultaneously disappointed and relieved.
						<br>
						I am glad to have given myself a beach day, even if I did it neurotically.  It was a good effort at the pleasant, quiet, afternoon I had been denying myself.  As I ride back to Astoria up another serene, drama-free path, my mind quiets.  I breathe deep.  I hear the breeze.  The measured movement up and down takes me towards home.  The entire journey feels like home.  It is as if I am already there.  This is the place I have been seeking, and every so often my bicycle takes me there.
