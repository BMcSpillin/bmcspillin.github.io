        It is a funny thing to present a portfolio at the beginning of a career.  I feel a bit like I am laying an egg without a chicken.  But an egg doesn't just materialize. Let's face it: neither the chicken nor the egg came first. That is the nature of evolution.

        It took some time inside and outside of educational institutions to identify the path I was already on, but looking back, the road is clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        At theater school, I learned collaboration.  I learned how to set an objective and focus on it relentlessly.  I learned how to make something out of nothing.

        In the service industry, I learned how to listen to people beyond even what their words expressed.  I learned how to express my needs to others.  I learned how to multitask.  I learned patience and the satisfaction I get from throwing myself into my work when things get intense.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no mistakes.  There are only opportunities for growth.  I learned this by being in my twenties.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also learned that once I stop growing, it is time to try a new challenge and grow again.  This is how I landed in code school.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is time to go somewhere unfamiliar, do something I feel awkward doing, and be someone who can thrive in any circumstance.
      </p>
      <p>
        My desire to travel has hardly been satisfied, but what I have learned by the occasional trips I've taken is that there are myriad cultures, and their qualities can be harnessed in essence.  I believe that the culture of each individual programming language has the same power, and I look forward to bringing my interest in relationships and linguistics to the Web, for the one we weave is tangled, but I prefer <strong>knots</strong> to <em>have nots</em>.
